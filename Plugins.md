All the plugins that are currently supported by OctoDash are listed here. Want to have an additional plugin supported? Please open a Pull Request with the implementation and some screenshots. Thanks!

### [DisplayLayerProgress](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/DisplayLayerProgress/)
DisplayLayerProgress is mandatory and needs to be installed for OctoDash to work. There are plans to make this optional, but currently, you need to have it installed, there will be lots of errors otherwise
### [Preheat Button](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/preheat/) 
Adds a preheat button to the loaded file screen.
### [Enclosure](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/enclosure/)
Adds support for a temperature display at the bottom of the main screen.
### [PSUControl](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/psucontrol/) 
Adds the option to turn on the printer if exiting from sleep mode and some additional [Custom Actions](https://github.com/UnchartedBull/OctoDash/wiki/Custom-Actions).
### [UltimakerFormatPackage](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/UltimakerFormatPackage/) 
Adds thumbnail images for .ufp files in the detailed file view, in the loaded file screen, and while a file is printing. To view the preview while printing just tap on the progress percentage. Tap again to return to the percentage.
### [PrintTimeGenius](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/PrintTimeGenius/)
Will greatly improve print time predictions, which will also be displayed within OctoDash
