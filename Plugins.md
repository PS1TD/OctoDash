All the plugins that are currently supported by OctoDash are listed here. Want to have an additional plugin supported? Please open a Pull Request with the implementation and some screenshots. Thanks!

### [DisplayLayerProgress](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/DisplayLayerProgress/)
DisplayLayerProgress is mandatory and needs to be installed for OctoDash to work. There are plans to make this optional, but currently, you need to have it installed, there will be lots of errors otherwise
### [FilamentManager](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/filamentmanager/)
Allows OctoDash to directly change the filament, if the filament is changed. This will also add an additional screen to the Filament Change Screen to choose the new filament.

Adds a preheat button to the loaded file screen.
