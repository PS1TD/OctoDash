It is recommended to use a 5" or 7" display with a resolution of 800x480 px. You shouldn't choose a screen smaller than 3.5" and with a lower resolution than 480x320 px.

The prebuilt electron app supports Raspberry Pi 2 and higher. The Raspberry Pi 1 is not supported and never will be supported. If you use a Pi 1 please use the Website Version or build the app yourself.

All other SoCs that are using an armv7, or arm64 compatible, processer are supported as well.

## Recommended Screens

Here are some screen, that should work fine with OctoDash, but you can, of course, choose whichever you like (even if it is not in the list). I'm not affiliated with any of these companies/marketplaces, it is where I buy my stuff and these are the screens I took into consideration, while buying my screen.

- [Raspberry Foundation 7" Screen](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/) - 7", 800x480, 60Hz, capacitive touch, ~$80 - works great, GPIOs are easily accessible
- [WaveShare 5" Screen](https://www.waveshare.com/5inch-hdmi-lcd.htm) - 5", 800x480, 60Hz, resistive touch, ~$40 - quality 5 inch screen
- [Generic 5" Screen](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32993813607.html) - 5", 800x480, 60Hz, resistive touch, ~$40 - WaveShare knockoff, should work fine
- [WaveShare 4.3" Screen](https://www.waveshare.com/4.3inch-hdmi-lcd-b.htm) - 4.3", 800x480, 60Hz, capacitive touch, ~$50 - IPS Panel supports wide viewing angle
- [Generic 3.5" Screen](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32587995145.html) - 3.5", 480x320, 1-2Hz, resistive touch, ~$10 - very cheap, I don't recommend it

If you ask me for only one recommendation I'd probably recommend the cheap 5" screen, if you have any of these Chinese Kit Printers, because it keeps the spirit of being cheap, while working relatively good. If you have a more expensive printer, or view the display from multiple angles go for the 4.3" IPS Display. An ideal display probably would be a 5" IPS Touchscreen with capacitive touch, that connects via HDMI to the Pi. I haven't found one yet though.

Development currently happens on the official 7" screen, but I'll probably switch to a 5" screen soon, because the 7" are a little too big for me.
