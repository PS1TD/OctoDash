*If you have a screen, or a System-on-a-Chip (SoC), that works great please let me know, so I can add them to this list*

It is recommended to use a 5" or 7" display with a resolution of 800x480 px. You shouldn't choose a screen smaller than 3.5" and with a lower resolution than 480x320 px.

The prebuilt electron app supports Raspberry Pi 2 and higher. The Raspberry Pi 1 and Pi Zero is not supported and never will be supported. If you use a Pi 1 please use the Website Version.

All other SoCs that are using an armv7, arm64, or amd64 compatible, processer are supported as well.

## Recommended Board / SoC

This is the same as for OctoPrint, I wouldn't recommend choosing anything slower than Pi 3 though to ensure a smooth operation.

SoCs from other vendors, such as PINE64 or OrangePi should work fine. Documentation and support are superior for the Raspberry Pi though, so I would go for the Pi personally.

## Recommended Screens

Here are some screen, that should work fine with OctoDash, but you can, of course, choose whichever you like (even if it is not on the list). You may want to step away from the super cheap ($10) screens, that connect via GPIO. Those usually have a very low refresh rate and you will most likely see some stutters while using the UI. I'm not affiliated with any of these companies/marketplaces, it is where I buy my stuff and these are the screens I took into consideration while buying my screen.
