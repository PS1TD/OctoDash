## SoC

Any System-on-a-Chip (SoC) or Computer that runs a Linux Distribution based on Debian will work (that includes Raspbian and OctoPi). All scripts and instructions are designed for a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian or OctoPi. OctoDash supports the following architectures:

- armv7 (Raspberry Pi 2 and newer)
- arm64
- amd64

The Raspberry Pi 1 and Pi Zero are not supported and never will be officially supported.

## Screen

Basically any screen that works with your device does work with OctoDash as well. The only soft constraints / recommendations are:

- Bigger than 3.5" (5" - 7" recommended)
- Resolution at least 480x320 (800x480 recommended)
- Landscape orientation
- Ideally touchscreen
