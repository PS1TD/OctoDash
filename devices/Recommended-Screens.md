Here are some screen, that should work fine with OctoDash. Those are just screens that are known to work without any issue, but you can of course, choose whichever you like.

You may want to step away from the super cheap ($10) screens, that connect via GPIO. Those usually have a very low refresh rate, which will result in choppy animation. Driver installation also can be quite hard for these screens, as there often isn't a user manual available.

I'm not affiliated with any of these companies/marketplaces.

@Will-wastelander did some more testing [here](https://gist.github.com/Will-wastelander/d59d5c517139fe388721b201895a3420).

I have used the Raspberry Foundation 7" and the OSOYOO 5" DSI screen and had no problems with either of them.
